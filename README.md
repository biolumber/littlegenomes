A python script to produce RNA virus genome diagrams in svg format from annotation data. The idea is to automate a task that would be a bit tiresome if done manually for large numbers of viruses found through metagenomic investigations.

I have worked on this previous to making a repository - from the 18/10/2018 to 24/01/2019. I am not really sure if I can add commits previous to my intial commit, but I might have a go later.

usage: littlegenomes.py [-h] [--squeeze {x,y,both}] [--max_height MAX_HEIGHT]
                        [--incre_height INCRE_HEIGHT]
                        <GENOME_TABLE> <ANNOTATION_TABLE> <OUTPUT_FILE>
